`qv-automate` uses `Gulp` to run specific tasks. 

Task can be started individually or one after another in the same run (check the **Examples** section). 

The module is installed globally and can be started from anywhere in cmd. 

The `settings.json` (file in the the current user documents folder) is used to define the qvw and data files, their prod/dev/test locations and git repository.
