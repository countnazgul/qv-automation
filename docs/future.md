Few more tasks should be added in the near future (woho! Holiday season :) )

* tasks based on the generated xml files. Like:
  * usage of local path in the script (C:\myapp\data.qvd)
  * macro module usage indicator
  * synth keys in the data model
  * generate log file should be checked
  * same font for all objects
  * etc. 
* version checker - check for new version of `qv-automate` on run (based no settings. auto-update on start?)
* log process
* user defined tasks
* clear the prod/dev/test environments (still haven't decided if this is such a good idea)
* copy from prod/dev/test
* rename the qvw after deploying is done
